# GitHub Pages Jekyll template

Title is self-explanatory.

The README.md file is not part of the Jekyll app.

[just-the-docs](https://github.com/just-the-docs/just-the-docs) is used as the Jekyll theme.

Another great Jekyll theme is [minimal-mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes).
